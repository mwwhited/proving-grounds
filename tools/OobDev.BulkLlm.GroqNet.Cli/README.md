# RebuildIt.GroqNet

AI-assisted code documentation tool that processes source code directories using Groq's cloud-based LLM API.

## Description

This tool scans directories of source code, reads files, generates prompts using Handlebars templates, and sends them to Groq's API for processing. It's configured to generate documentation but can be adapted for other code transformations.

## Current Configuration

- **Input Path**: `C:\Repos\Application\Net.Libs\docs`
- **Output Path**: `.\Net.Core\src`
- **Template**: `GenerateDocumentationForThisCode.md.hbs`
- **LLM Backend**: Groq Cloud API
- **Model**: LLaMA3-8b

## Requirements

- Groq API key must be set in environment variable: `API_Key_Groq` (User scope)

## Status

The file extraction logic (lines 83-89 in Program.cs) is currently commented out, so the tool only generates and saves LLM responses without automatically creating output files.

## Process Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "RebuildIt.GroqNet" as App
participant "File System" as FS
participant "Handlebars" as HBS
participant "Groq API" as LLM

User -> App: Start application
App -> App: Load API_Key_Groq from environment
App -> FS: Scan directories from inputPath
loop For each directory
    App -> FS: Read source files (<10KB, exclude PDFs)
    App -> HBS: Compile template with file data
    HBS --> App: Generated prompt
    App -> FS: Save prompt to output folder
    App -> LLM: Send prompt (GetChatCompletionsAsync)
    LLM --> App: Response content
    App -> FS: Save response.md
    App -> FS: Save response.json
    note right: File extraction\ncurrently disabled
end
