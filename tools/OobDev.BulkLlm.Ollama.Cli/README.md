# RebuildIt.Cli

AI-assisted code generation tool that processes source code directories using a local LLM via Ollama.

## Description

This tool scans directories of source code, reads files, generates prompts using Handlebars templates, and sends them to a local Ollama instance for processing. It's configured to generate unit tests but can be adapted for other code transformations.

## Current Configuration

- **Input Path**: `C:\Repos\Application\Net.Api`
- **Output Path**: `.\Net.Api\tests`
- **Template**: `GenerateUnitTests.md.hbs`
- **LLM Backend**: Ollama (http://192.168.1.170:11434)
- **Model**: llama3:instruct

## Status

The file extraction logic (lines 72-78 in Program.cs) is currently commented out, so the tool only generates and saves LLM responses without automatically creating output files.

## Process Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "RebuildIt.Cli" as App
participant "File System" as FS
participant "Handlebars" as HBS
participant "Ollama" as LLM

User -> App: Start application
App -> FS: Scan directories from inputPath
loop For each directory
    App -> FS: Read source files
    App -> HBS: Compile template with file data
    HBS --> App: Generated prompt
    App -> FS: Save prompt to output folder
    App -> LLM: Send prompt (GetCompletion)
    LLM --> App: Response content
    App -> FS: Save response.md
    App -> FS: Save response.json
    note right: File extraction\ncurrently disabled
end

## Dependencies

- HandlebarsDotNet (template engine)
- OllamaSharp (local LLM client)

## Usage

1. Configure the input/output paths and template in `Program.cs`
2. Ensure Ollama is running at the configured endpoint
3. Run the application
