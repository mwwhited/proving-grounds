# Hybrid Search Engine and Document Store

## Summary

This is will be an example file store that will integrate multiple search options.  It should be build 
around off the self components that can be swapped out based on needs

## Planned features

* [x] Hybrid Search
  * [x] Semantic Search
    * [x] using `all-mpnet-base-v2` sentence transformer
    * [x] using `Qdrant`
    * [ ] aggregate 
  * [x] Lexical Search 
    * [x] powered by `Open Search`
      * painful overkill for just full-text search... though it looks to have vector search features as well.
    * [x] aggregate 
  * [x] Reranking
    * [x] powered by --TBD--
* [ ] Document Management
  * [x] Document Generation
    * [x] enables document summarization
    * [x] powered by `Ollama`
    * [x] using ~~phi-2, llama-2:7b, llama-2:13b~~ `mistral:instruct`
    * [x] code name `muse`
  * [x] Persistance and Retrieval
    * [x] powered `Azurite`
  * [ ] File Conversion
    * [x] Markdown to HTML powered `Markdig`
    * [ ] HTML to PDF powered --TBD--
  * [ ] File Packing/Unpacking
    * [ ] Zip powered by --TBD--
* [ ] Authentication and Authorization
  * [ ] Claims based Authorization
    * [ ] powered `Keycloak`

## Details

### Hybrid Search

Hybrid search is a a feature to do a ranked combination search.  This mean mixing the results from 
multiple search providers to help provide more relevant results for the user.  

#### Semantic Search

Semantic search is a means to search through information based on conceptual context.  This uses a 
nearest neighbor vector search

#### Lexical Search

Lexical search provides search results based on a thesaurus and inverted indexes.  

#### Re-ranking

Re-ranking will adjust search scoring results based on previous user actions.  The idea would be to 
have a simple ANN that can monitor user interations to help improve ranking per user

### Document Management

#### Documentation Summarization

Based on the uploaded content type the system will perform a summary generation.  Some examples may include...

* Image to Text: using an AI model to evaluate an image and provide a meaningful description
* Text to Text: review the content of an existing body of text and generate a meaningful summary

## Notes and References

* First Notes
    * Use ollama with and llm to generate summaries of documents in blob store
    * Add lexical search with open search
    * Add classification to vectors such as content, summary, file name to allow searching across all of select items
    * Generate interlaced search result using both semantic and lexical result
    * Add claims Based filtering to show authorization
    * Markdown to html conversion with caching
    * Conversion caching with caching
    * Plantuml to png with caching
    * Setup as a deployable cluster
